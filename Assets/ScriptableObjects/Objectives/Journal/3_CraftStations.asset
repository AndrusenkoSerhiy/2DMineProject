  entryName: Craft Stations
  subName: If I want to survive, I need to build.
  description: "I found different stations that help me craft things:\nWorkbench
    \u2014 basic tools and items\nForge - smelts ores with using coal\nStonecutter
    \u2014 stone blocks and solid parts\nFood Station \u2014 cooking meals with using
    coal\nChemical Station \u2014 strange mixtures and advanced stuff\nCrafting takes
    time.\nSome items are fast, some take longer.\nStations can only craft one thing
    at a time, so I need to plan and make sequences for craft.\nWhen I find new ingredients,
    I sometimes discover new recipes."
