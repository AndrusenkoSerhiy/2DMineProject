  description: 'I found robots.

    Or maybe they found me.

    Robots help with
    daily tasks and make life easier.

    They can carry items and have extra inventory
    slots.

    Each robot is different:

    Some are good for mining

    Some
    for building

    Some for other strange tasks

    Robots are powerful, but
    they need to be used wisely.

    I feel safer when one is nearby.'
